# KatOS

Welcome to the KatOS repo, where build scripts for making core parts of KatOS are stored.
KatOS is a collab between kittyhacker101, tbodt, and joyesh to make a lightweight and modern operating system.
This project is a very early work in progress, and much work needs to be done before it is complete.

# Directory Structure
- Core - Core parts of the KatOS system
- Root - Basic rootfs for installed system.
- Installer - Build scripts for installer iso.
- Source - Packaged files used in KatOS.

# Building
- To build all parts of KatOS, type `./buildall.sh` in your terminal.
- To remove all compiled binaries from your folder, type `./clean.sh` in your terminal.
