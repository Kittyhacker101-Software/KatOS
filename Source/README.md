# Source
This is where packaged files used in parts of KatOS are stored in various formats.
To download these files, type `./download.sh` into your terminal. This downloads about 100MB of files, and make take a while if you have a slow internet connection.

# Updating
To update files in here, change the link in the download.sh folder, delete all existing downloaded files, and then redownload everything. You may have to rebuild components of KatOS if you have built them already. If you have to rebuild core components, cleaning and rebuilding all KatOS files is reccomended.

# Issues
If you have any issues with the build scripts breaking due to an update, file an issue and notify me of the problem.
If you are having issues with the build scripts not detecting the updated component, make sure the naming scheme and file extention for the new link is similar to the old link.
